          <p>Description: </p>
          <p>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.

            Across the far-flung worlds of the Imperium of Mankind, in a galaxy riven by warp storms and unceasing conflict, the armies of Humanity battle for survival. With the Imperium already standing upon the brink of annihilation, the Tyranid hive fleets emerge from the cold void between the stars. The Space Marines stand as the last line of defence between this ravenous alien menace and the beleaguered worlds of the Imperium.
