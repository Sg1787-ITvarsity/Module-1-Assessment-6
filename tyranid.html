          <p>Description: </p>
          <p>Each Norn Emissary is a purpose-bred beast,        spawned by its Norn Queen to accomplish a        specific and singular objective – be it          hunting a strategically gifted commander,        abducting a knowledgeable prey-being, or         pursuing some other ineffable goal. These           colossal heralds of the Hive Mind's agenda      meld terrifying psionic potential with           speed, intelligence, and monstrous strength,     ensuring that a Norn Emissary is more than        equal to its alien task.
              
              This multipart plastic kit builds a Norn Emissary, a psychic monster tailored to overcome all resistance. Stood atop a ruined structure covered in Tyranid growths, the Emissary shreds all opposition with massive scything talons and cruel, dextrous claws, its visible brain tissue suffused with unnatural power. The Norn Emissary stands amongst the larger creatures in the Tyranids range, towering above even a Hive Tyrant – it's an excellent centrepiece model, loaded with alien detail to show off your painting skills. The kit also includes two different lower torsos, allowing you to pose your Emissary surveying the battlefield or leering down at its prey.

              This miniature can alternatively be built as a Norn Assimilator, a single-minded Tyranid monster with toxic bone harpoons.

              This kit comprises 58 plastic components and comes with a Citadel 100mm Round Base. This miniature is supplied unpainted and requires assembly – we recommend using Citadel Plastic Glue and Citadel Colour paints.</p>
