          <p>Space Marines are genetically augmented warriors, created as Humanity’s ultimate shock troops. Formally known as the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines have defended the Imperium for over ten thousand years. They go to war armed and armoured with the best wargear the Imperium can provide, complementing their enhanced strength, agility, and resilience. They are steeled in mind, body and soul to endure ceaseless war, facing the most monstrous threats throughout the galaxy and knowing no fear.

            These steadfast warrior knights each belong to a Chapter – a close-knit brotherhood that dispatches strike forces of Space Marines across the galaxy. Supported by transport vehicles, battle tanks, combat walkers, attack craft, and powerful artillery, they execute lightning assaults of blistering speed and power. The Space Marines are the Emperor’s fury made manifest, and all his enemies fear them as the Angels of Death.
